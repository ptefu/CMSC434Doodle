# CMSC434Doodle project by Joseph Wu

The program can be run on emulator through android studio or on an android device. The app is a simplistic design with 4 main features.
The button on the left opens up a color wheel that allows you to pick both the color and opacity. Choose the color first then select the
opacity with the lever around the wheel. The middle button clears the entire drawing. The right button allows you to open up a popup menu
which allows you to select from predefined pixel sizes. The last feature is a shake feature which fills in the screen with color selected,
allowing a quick background fill before drawing. The shake feature can only be tested on a android device not the emulator.
